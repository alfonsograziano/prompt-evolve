I’d hit snooze and feel exhausted.\n  But then I started using a consistent bedtime and a light alarm clock.\n  Within a week, I was waking up at 6AM, and I had a whole extra hour to journal, exercise, and plan my day.\n  That single change—getting up before the world does—transformed how I show up in my job and my life."
