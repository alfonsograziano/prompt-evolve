# Prompt-evolve

Prompt-evolve is a tool designed to automatically improve and evolve LLM (Large Language Model) prompts to better match desired outputs. It implements an iterative approach to prompt engineering, using the power of LLMs themselves to enhance prompt effectiveness.

## Features

- üîÑ Iterative prompt evolution
- üìù Template-based prompt system with variable support
- üìä Detailed telemetry and iteration tracking
- üîç Automatic difference evaluation between current and ideal outputs
- üìà Progress monitoring and logging
- üíæ Telemetry data export (JSON or beautiful HTML report)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd prompt-evolve
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

The project provides three main ways to run prompt evolution:

### 1. Basic Usage

```typescript
import { promptEvolve } from "./index";

const result = await promptEvolve({
  initialPromptTemplate: "Generate a title for: ${content}",
  variables: [
    {
      name: "content",
      description: "The content to generate a title for",
      example: "A story about a brave cat",
    },
  ],
  idealOutput: "The Brave Cat's Tale",
  model: "gpt-4",
  maxIterations: 5,
  telemetry: {
    filePath: "telemetry.json",
  },
});
```

#### Enabling the HTML Reporter

To generate a beautiful, interactive HTML report of the prompt evolution process, set the `reporterType` to `"html"` in the telemetry options:

```typescript
telemetry: {
  filePath: "telemetry.html",
  reporterType: "html",
},
```

### 2. Running from Examples

```bash
npm run run-from-examples
```

### 3. Running from File

```bash
npm run run-from-file "./path/to/file.json"
```

## Configuration Options

The `promptEvolve` function accepts the following parameters:

- `initialPromptTemplate`: The starting prompt template with variable placeholders
- `variables`: Array of variable definitions with name, description, and example
- `idealOutput`: The target output you want to achieve
- `model`: The OpenAI model to use (e.g., "gpt-4")
- `maxIterations`: Maximum number of evolution iterations
- `telemetry`: Optional telemetry configuration (set `reporterType` to `"html"` for HTML report)
- `currentOutput`: Optional initial output to start with

## How It Works

1. **Prompt Rendering**: Converts template with variables into actual prompts
2. **Evaluation**: Compares current output with ideal output
3. **Evolution**: Uses LLM to improve the prompt based on the difference
4. **Iteration**: Repeats the process until maxIterations is reached
5. **Telemetry**: Records detailed information about each iteration

## Output

The system returns:

- `finalPromptTemplate`: The evolved prompt template
- `finalOutput`: The last output generated
- `history`: Complete evolution history

If telemetry is enabled, it also saves detailed iteration data to the specified file. If you use `reporterType: "html"`, the output will be a visually rich HTML report.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- OpenAI API key
